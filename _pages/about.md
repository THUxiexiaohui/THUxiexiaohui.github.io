I am now a fifth year Ph.D. student in [THUIR group](http://www.thuir.cn/), [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn) in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My supervisor is Prof. [Yiqun Liu](http://www.thuir.cn/group/~YQLiu/). My research interests are multimedia search, user behavior modeling, evaluation metrics and etc.

Recent Professional Activities
======
* Our paper ***"Models Versus Satisfaction: Towards a Better Understanding of Evaluation Metrics"*** won the **Best Paper Honorable Mention** at [SIGIR 2020](https://sigir.org/sigir2020/).
* I gave a tutorial on ***"Modeling user behavior for vertical search: Images, Apps and Products"*** on SIGIR 2020. 
* I serve as reviewer of IPM, TOIS, CIKM 2019, theWebConf 2020.
* I serve as [Student Liaison of SIGIR](https://sites.google.com/view/sigir-students/about).
* Our paper ***"A search engine click model based on deep neural network"*** won the **Best Student Paper Award** at [CCIR 2016](http://ccir2016.ccnl.scut.edu.cn/index.php).
